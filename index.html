       Hi! My name is Kat, I am currently a freshman majoring in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Welcome to my site, "Through the Hapa Lens"! For those of you who don't know, a hapa is one who is half asian; I am mixed with Filipino and Italian blood.

       While my family comes from two very different countries, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, where the stars strut, the beaches call, the weather rocks, and the cultures collide.

            For mouth-watering food images, select the "Food" tab at the top of the page. If you're interested in learning about a student's social life in an engineering school (it exists I promise... well at least for orientation week), check out the "College" tab. And finally for contact info, select "Contact"! Duh.
